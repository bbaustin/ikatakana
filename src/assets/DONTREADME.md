- UP NEXT:

* make footer background white
* mobile keyboard will smoosh the view. Make sure all inputs are visible on mobile

- FINISHED:

  - post on github.io etc
  - give up button (restart points)
    - skip should reset the input and bring you to info screen (not new word)
  - make enter submit the "OK" button (forced focus arguably not great)
  - make UI friendlier (for now)
  - expand katakana list. look into way of automizing upload
  - favicon
  - case insensitive (just use JS)
  - add padding to bottom of help component

- BACKLOG:

* better handling of return button on feedback page
* animation for correct
* add countries to vocab
* avoid seeing the same vocab twice
  - should probably use Set
* make za, ha, ba, pa, etc. work. via button? i guess so
* FIRST you want japanese word, with english typing only. So that simplifies your beta version. Don't program keyboard.
* create alternate game with matching the definition
  - with this, get definition to be an array (which would cause changes elsewhere)
* start a fresh git repo
